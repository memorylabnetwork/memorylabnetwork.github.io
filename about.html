									<h4>What is the Memory Lab Network?</h4>
									<p>In spring 2017, the Institute of Museum and Library Services awarded DC Public Library (DCPL), in partnership with the Public Library Association (PLA), a National Leadership Grant to build Memory Lab digital preservation programs in seven public libraries across the U.S. based on the DCPL Memory Lab model.
Through an application process, seven public libraries have been identified as Memory Lab Network project partners. Two ambassadors from each library will attend a week-long digital preservation bootcamp in Washington, D.C., April 16-20, 2018 as the kickoff to spending one year creating personal archiving stations and programs for their communities following the DCPL model. Memory Lab Network partners will receive training, mentoring and financial support to create digitization stations and curricula to build public knowledge and skills around the complex and paralyzing problems of personal digital archiving through their own Memory Lab programs. Since the grant was awarded, Library of Congress National Digital Initiatives joined the project as a training and outreach partner.</p>

									<h4>What is the Memory Lab model?</h4>
									<p>DC Public Library’s Memory Lab was established in 2015 by a year-long National Digital Stewardship Residency (NDSR), resulting in a “do-it-yourself” program consisting of three key components: A digitization lab with equipment for digitizing video and audio and scanning photographs, documents and slides in a public computing space; digital preservation class curricula and training for the public; and a website with equipment and workflow instructions and resources for long-term storage and preservation of analog and digital archival materials. The NDSR project final report and the original project proposal are both available online. The residency was funded by the Institute for Museum and Library Services and administered by the Library ngss.
