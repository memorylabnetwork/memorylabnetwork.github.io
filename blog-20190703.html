										<h4>July 3, 2019: MLN @ ALA</h4>
										<p>Written by Siobhan Hagan, DCPL, Memory Lab Network Project Manager</p>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pueblo-01.jpg" alt="" /></span>DC Public Library’s Memory Lab Network was fortunate to receive a booth at this year’s annual conference of the American Library Association (ALA) that took place at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. ALA is the oldest and largest library professional organization in the world. Approximately 25,000 people attend the conference and the epic Exhibit Hall is, according to ALA’s <a href=”https://2019.alaannual.org/exhibit-hall”>website</a>, where attendees get “the opportunity to explore and discuss with expert vendors the breadth and depth of new and favorite library products, services, books, online services, tools, and technologies.” I had attended several ALA’s previously, but have never been a vendor in an exhibit hall, let alone a vendor in the largest conference I have ever been to.

<p>
<span class="image right"><img src="images/pueblo-02.jpg" alt="" /></span>We set up our booth on Friday for the opening reception Friday evening (June 21), and then I was there that Saturday and Sunday, and most of the day on Monday. I spoke to hundreds of people about DC Public Library’s Memory Lab model and how the IMLS-funded Memory Lab Network project is bringing “Preservation to the People” by providing Memory Labs to organizations across the US. I showed where our first cohort of the Network is located and announced our call for applications for our second cohort. I had a VHS digitization station that I set-up on the booth’s table that attracted a lot of people’s attention, and I even included a broken CRT monitor to represent the fact that building a Memory Lab will be full of troubleshooting, things breaking, and changing of plans--but that we learn from our mistakes, help each other through the tough moments, and are overall stronger together. <a href=”https://memorylabnetwork.github.io/join.html”>Apply</a> to join the second cohort of the Memory Lab Network today! We also have a webinar to learn more on July 12 (please register <a href=”https://zoom.us/meeting/register/bc7cceaee401a38166858a512be5123a”>here</a>). </p>
