									<p>PROJECT INFORMATION</p>
									<p><i>What's a Memory Lab?</i><br>
A “do-it-yourself” program consisting of three key components: a lab with equipment for transferring audio and video and scanning photographs, documents, and slides in a public computing space; digital preservation class curricula and training for the public; and a website with equipment and workflow instructions and resources for long-term storage and preservation of analog and digital materials. 
							</p>
									<p><i>What's the Memory Lab Network?</i><br>
In spring 2017, the Institute of Museum and Library Services awarded DC Public Library (DCPL) a National Leadership Grant to build Memory Lab preservation programs in public libraries across the U.S. based on the DCPL Memory Lab model. 
									All Memory Lab Network partners receive training, mentoring and financial support to create digitization stations and curricula to build public knowledge and skills around the complex and paralyzing problems of personal digital archiving through their own Memory Lab programs. The project will result in open documentation and training materials for future implementations of the Memory Lab model on a global scale.</p>
									<p><i>How long is the Memory Lab Network project?</i><br>
Over one year beginning September 2019, two staff members at each partner library will dedicate a combined 10 hours weekly to building the lab and contributing to the project. The library is responsible for maintaining the lab once the project has ended.
							</p>
									<p><i>What is the timeline for the project?</i><br>
