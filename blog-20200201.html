										<h4>February 1, 2020: Cohort Two Bootcamp Training <br></h4>
										<p>Written by Siobhan Hagan, Memory Lab Network Project Manager</p>
									</header>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/bootcamp02-inperson.jpg" alt="" /></span>The Memory Lab Network has completed its second in-person training for its second cohort (fondly referred to as "bootcamp")! Two representatives from each of our second cohort partner libraries travelled in January from all over America to Washington, D.C. for this intensive training at DC Public Library's Northeast Branch.Prior to meeting in person, the second cohort had met virtual several times for indepth lectures on introductory topics that would form the foundation for the learning we would conduct inperson.  It was amazing to meet everyone face to face and to learn more about each other and our communities. </p>
                                    <p>The first day started after lunch on Tuesday, January 21, 2020. We started with a long welcome with introductions, first from DC Public Library staff, and then having the ambassadors from each library stand up and introduce themselves and their communities. In addition to our Memory Lab Network second cohort, on our first day we also welcomed staff from Queens College in New York City, who were also in the process of building a Memory Lab. Since we were having our training at our Northeast Neighborhood Library branch, we had the opportunity for DC Public Library staff member Robert LaRose to give a tour of our Memory Lab. After this, Rebecca Reeves from Frederick County Public Library brought her library system's Mobile Memory Lab with her for our attendees to view and touch in person. We were able to have a lively discussion with Robert and Rebecca, two Memory Lab running experts, and lots of questions were answered and seeds of thoughts planted. To continue the discussion, we split everyone into pairs, making sure to have each person pair up with someone from a different library. They then had a brainstorming session to set goals and expectations for themselves, as well as to get to know eachother better (the form we asked them to use to facilitate this is ,a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R6VBe65j6QUJC3U5zvD7Y4JqdwmSMmGCjE4yQf8Na98/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>). To close out the first day, everyone travelled to Dupont Circle that evening for a Memory Lab Network reception, where we could more informally get to know eachother over food and beverages.</p>
                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/bootcamp02-vhs.jpg" alt="" /></span>The second day we hit the ground running at the Northeast Library with several hands-on training stations: partners learned and practiced how to rehouse VHS and compact cassette tapes, how to clean a VHS deck and audio compact cassette deck, how to work a Super8mm/8mm film viewer, and even how to make DCPL's Maximum Preservation zines to hand out at their future classes. Each group also was able to get more firsthand experience with our Memory Lab. After lunch, we all met at the Smithsonian Institute's National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) for a private tour of their Media Conservation Labs and to learn more about their Community Curation Project. It was integral to see NMAAHC's state of the art video, audio, and film transfer stations in order to compare, contrast, and fully understand the differences between that and a Memory Lab transfer station. The rest of the day the cohort had free time to explore the NMAAHC exhibits on their own--we didn't want our guests to miss this amazing and important museum. </p>
                                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/bootcamp02-LC.jpg" alt="" /></span>The next day at the Northeast Library we started by taking a moment to survey the crowd--what were they feeling more confident about? What did they feel like they still needed work on? Then we dove in again on hands-on training, having each library view a wiring diagram (basically a picture that shows how equipment should be hooked up) and had them put together a digital transfer station and make it work, from a VHS digitization station, an audio digitization station, to photograph and transparency scanners. That morning was the time to address areas that people wanted more practice: some spent more time at our Memory Lab, some spent more time practicing VHS reshelling. After lunch, we met back at the Library of Congress Jefferson Building to be met by more Memory Lab alumni: Jaime Mears, who was the NDSR resident who initially researched and built the DC Public Library Memory Lab, and Lauren Algee, former Digital Curation Librarian at DC Public Library who helped start the initial Memory Lab as well as the Memory Lab Network project: both now work at the Library of Congress and are on the Advisory Board for the Memory Lab Network. Through their assistane and the generosity of their colleagues, our group was taken on a tour throughout several units of the Library of Congress, from Preservation and Reformatting to Manuscripts. It was a rare treat to see highlights from their collections, as well as to learn preservation and archiving tips that partners could bring back to their communities for their personal archives.</p>
						
						 <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/bootcamp02-cohort2.jpg" alt="" /></span>Our last day on January 24 was a time to ask our last questions and to start planning. Each ambassador partnered up with their colleague at their partner library to discuss and fill out a project planning form (you can see this form <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vE_0IXj5vbgQIz5Omq4hjfqCjZkclUNkJiJ1O-Qom6M/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>). Afterwards, DCPL staff member Biljana "B" Milenkovic presented on her experience teaching preservation literacy skills and related programming to various DCPL library branches--"B" and Robert are experienced DCPL Memory Lab teachers, and were available throughout the week's training to assist in training and answering questions. We closed out the day with time for last discussions and questions, and of course goodbyes. It was a whirlwind week with lots of new knowledge, resources, friends, and colleagues acquired. We are so excited to see the Memory Lab Network grow and expand in the coming year!</p>
