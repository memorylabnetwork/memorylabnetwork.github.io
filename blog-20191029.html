								<p><i><b>Federal Grant Supports Digital Preservation Programs at Libraries</i></p>
								<p>(Washington, D.C.)</b> - People and families in seven communities are one step closer to being able to digitize and preserve videotapes, photographs and other family keepsakes at their library. Their libraries have been awarded a Memory Lab Network Grant.</p>
								<p>Tehama County Library, CA; Calcasieu Parish Public Library, LA; Middle Georgia Regional Library, GA; Central Arkansas Library System, AR; Tulare County Library, CA; Free Library of Philadelphia, PA; and Chesapeake Public Library, VA are the recipients of the grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS).</p>
								<p>“As centers of learning and catalysts of community change, libraries and museums connect people with programs, services, collections, information, and new ideas in the arts, sciences, and humanities. They serve as vital spaces where people can connect with each other,” said IMLS Director Dr. Kathryn K. Matthew. “IMLS is proud to support their work through our grantmaking as they inform and inspire all in their communities.”</p>
								<p>More than 25 libraries applied for the program. The finalists were selected based on their interest and commitment, location, library system size and population served. The DC Public Library is administering the grant.</p>
								<p>Under the grant, the libraries will attend an in-depth digital-preservation boot camp in Washington, D.C. At the camp, staff will receive digital preservation training and equipment recommendations that support their respective digital archiving programs. The project will also create training materials that other libraries can use to develop similar programs.</p>
								<p>This is the second cohort to receive grants. The program is modeled after the DC Public Library’s Memory Lab, which features technology like professional-grade scanners and VCRs along with step-by-step instructions for saving items in a digital format. Since the lab’s launch in 2016, patrons have booked more than 1,400 sessions and digitized more than 4,000 hours of video, audio cassettes and other personal materials.</p>
